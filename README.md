# Project Name :: RAS (Result Analysis System)
# DBMS Mini Project :: 

## Abstract
Analysis of the scoring system it shows by the grade wise result of individual subject and final result also display grade wise.depending on its range of marks. The project can be easily used in college for college result analysis of student. It reduces time which required for manual calculation.

**Problem Statement :**

University results of students pursuing their under-graduation are currently sent to the respective colleges via a PDF format soft copy. These results are manually entered by the teachers and faculty into an excel sheet for evaluating the overall result. This method however is time consuming and repetitive and is inefficient in evaluating the result and does not provide proper insights of these results. Hence in order to quickly and efficiently evaluate and visualize these results, there is a need of an automated utility that will take the university result as input, in PDF format and generate a spreadsheet of these results, effortlessly visualize these results on a dashboard in the form of charts and graphs, perform basic analysis on these results and display trends and variations of past and latest results. The utility should be capable of performing the above tasks both for individual result records as well as the results as a whole. The utility should have proper functionalities and access controls for each individual end user such as i)Teaching Faculty &amp; other college staff ii)Head of Department iii) Principal iv)Student.


**The end users of this utility are as follows:**

1. **Teacher**  **/ Professor**

1. Create and manage a teacher/ professor profile.
2. Input a PDF result file and generate spreadsheet output of the same.
3. Visualise all results data.
4. Get basic analysis.
5. Get results data from any individual student profile.

**2) Head of the Department / Principal**

1. Create and manage HOD / Principal profile.
2. Visualise all results data.
3. Get basic analysis.
4. Get results data from any individual student profile.

**3) Student**

1. Create and manage student profiles.
2. Display all personal results.
3. Compare Results.

**Purpose**** :**

In a manual system i.e. manually uploading the results, is a very time-consuming process. Teacher has to manually analyze the results and getting an overview of the result is difficult. For Students, there is no direct accessibility to all his previous results at any time . In our project the teacher has to just upload the current year result file and all analysis (overall and subject wise ) will be performed by the system.The system also computes year-wise trends to show a comparison of the current result with the previous year. Students can have access to their results at any time.

**Scope:**

The scope of the project is to make the working result analysis software, in which teachers can get the user-friendly interface to easily upload the result and easily analyze result of the different students on one-click using data processing and analysis, This system enables teachers to analyze the result of a particular student or result of all student in a particular year.
